# NeuroAwareness: AI-Driven Workplace Well-being

NeuroAwareness is a proactive mental health platform designed for the modern corporate environment. It moves beyond subjective surveys by using **Digital Phenotyping** to detect "Micro-Burnout" and provide real-time, data-driven interventions.

## 🚀 The Problem
Current employee well-being strategies rely on infrequent, subjective surveys prone to bias and "survey fatigue." This often fails to detect early signs of burnout, leading to decreased productivity and high turnover.

## 💡 The Solution
NeuroAwareness utilizes **Passive Neuro-Aggregation** to analyze digital behavior—such as typing rhythms and app-switching frequency—to model cognitive agility and stress levels without compromising privacy.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Passive Data Acquisition**: Non-intrusive collection of digital phenotyping data.
- **Neurocognitive Scoring**: Real-time "Cognitive Health Score" generated by AI.
- **Threshold-Based Interventions**: Automated suggestions for "Bio-Breaks" and mental exercises.
- **HR Dashboards**: Anonymized heatmaps for organizational health monitoring.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The platform is built on a cloud-native AWS stack:
- **Edge Layer**: Electron.js desktop agent for telemetry capture.
- **Ingestion Layer**: AWS Kinesis Data Streams.
- **Processing Layer**: AWS SageMaker for stress/fatigue modeling.
- **Storage Layer**: Amazon Timestream for time-series wellness scores.
- **Presentation Layer**: React-based dashboards and cross-platform notifications.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Performance
- **Privacy-First**: Raw data is encrypted and processed in isolated environments; HR only sees anonymized, aggregated data.
- **Low Impact**: The background worker consumes < 1% CPU to ensure no interference with primary work.
- **Scalable**: Serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) built to handle thousands of concurrent users.

## 👥 User Personas
- **Individual Contributors**: Manage personal mental energy with tailored prompts.
- **HR/Team Leads**: Monitor trends to adjust deadlines and resources proactively.
